# Hello, I'm Isaac Giggs

I'm learning how to use Github.

I figure this is a convienent place to keep a coding portfolio.

Im very interested in simulation, and just recently I've created and documented my thinking through implementing a gravity simulator (see simulating.ipynb)
I've got to get a better method for displaying the simulation because matplotlib.animation is very slow for this
